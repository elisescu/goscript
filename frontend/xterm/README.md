xterm
=====

This contains a hacked version of [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/) library, which
was modified to disable the selectionManager, so that the text selection and clipboard will be
handled by the browser.

The modified version of the xterm, with the horrible hacks mentioned above, can be found somewhere
next to this repo.
