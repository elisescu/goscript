========

Folder containing anything related to the code that runs in the browser, and that plays the
recorded terminal session.

The browser code will be generated by webpack and packed in a single js file that is then included
in the final html page. The html page is generated by the goscript tool by filling in the templates
which can be found in `./templates/` folder. These contain the header and footer of the final html
page. Header and footer are probably misnomers, since they are in this case just as the first part
of the html and the last part of the html, between which the goscript tool will just dump the
recorded session, as a json javascript object.
